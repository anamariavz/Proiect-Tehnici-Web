00:01.000 --> 00:06.590
<c.Sub>When repairing a small cavity, a <u>composite</u> filling can restore your tooth to shape and function,</c>

00:07.000 --> 00:13.590
<c.Sub>while also mimicking the tooth's natural shade. During the first step your tooth is prepared by</c> 

00:14.000 --> 00:17.590
<c.Sub>removing the decayed portion, leaving a small area that will be filled with the composite.</c>

00:18.000 --> 00:24.590
<c.Sub>Next a special bonding agent is applied to the prepared area. This bonding process helps</c>

00:25.000 --> 00:30.590
<c.Sub>to ensure that the filling will attach to the natural tooth structure. A special curing light</c>

00:31.000 --> 00:37.590
<c.Sub>is then used to set the bonding fluid. Your dentist then applies the composite material</c>

00:38.000 --> 00:41.590
<c.Sub>to fill the prepared area and shapes it to match the contours of your tooth surface.</c>

00:42.000 --> 00:47.590
<c.Sub>Again using the special curing light, the shaped composite is hardened to resist the</c>

00:48.000 --> 00:53.590
<c.Sub>force of the opposing teeth. As a final step, your dentist will polish the composite filling</c>

00:54.000 --> 00:58.590
<c.Sub>to smoothen it and give it a similar sheen to the rest of your tooth. Once completed,</c>

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
<c.Sub>your tooth is free of decay and restored to its natural strength and appearance</c>
