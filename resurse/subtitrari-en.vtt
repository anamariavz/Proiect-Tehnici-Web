When repairing a small cavity, a <u>composite</u> filling can restore your tooth to shape and function,

00:07.000 --> 00:13.590
while also mimicking the tooth's natural shade. During the first step your tooth is prepared by

00:14.000 --> 00:17.590
removing the decayed portion, leaving a small area that will be filled with the composite.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.590
Next a special bonding agent is applied to the prepared area. This bonding process helps

00:25.000 --> 00:30.590
to ensure that the filling will attach to the natural tooth structure. A special curing light

00:31.000 --> 00:37.590
is then used to set the bonding fluid. Your dentist then applies the composite material

00:38.000 --> 00:41.590
to fill the prepared area and shapes it to match the contours of your tooth surface.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.590
Again using the special curing light, the shaped composite is hardened to resist the

00:48.000 --> 00:53.590
force of the opposing teeth. As a final step, your dentist will polish the composite filling

00:54.000 --> 00:58.590
to smoothen it and give it a similar sheen to the rest of your tooth. Once completed,

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
your tooth is free of decay and restored to its natural strength and appearance
