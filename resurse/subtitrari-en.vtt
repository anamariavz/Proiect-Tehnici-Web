When repairing a small cavity, a <u>composite</u> filling can restore your tooth to shape and function,

00:00:07.00 --> 00:00:13.59
while also mimicking the tooth's natural shade. During the first step your tooth is prepared by 

00:00:14.00 --> 00:00:17.59
removing the decayed portion, leaving a small area that will be filled with the composite.

00:00:18.00 --> 00:00:24.59
Next a special bonding agent is applied to the prepared area. This bonding process helps

00:00:25.00 --> 00:00:30.59
to ensure that the filling will attach to the natural tooth structure. A special curing light

00:00:31.00 --> 00:00:37.59
is then used to set the bonding fluid. Your dentist then applies the composite material

00:00:38.00 --> 00:00:41.59
to fill the prepared area and shapes it to match the contours of your tooth surface.

00:00:42.00 --> 00:00:47.59
Again using the special curing light, the shaped composite is hardened to resist the 

00:00:48.00 --> 00:00:53.59
force of the opposing teeth. As a final step, your dentist will polish the composite filling

00:00:54.00 --> 00:00:58.59
to smoothen it and give it a similar sheen to the rest of your tooth. Once completed, 

00:00:59.00 --> 00:01:05.00
your tooth is free of decay and restored to its natural strength and appearance
